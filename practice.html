    	<p>I will be turning 43 this year and I am still trying to figure out my life. I've always been too analytic for my own
        good, so naturally, coding seemed to be a great fit. I enjoy creating and disassembling things to see how
        they "work" and I think this is a perfect avenue to explore and take advantage of this natural tendency.</p>
    <br>            
        <p>My hobbies include cooking, music (both recorded and live), video games and traveling. I have studied the Korean
        language and enjoy cooking Korean cuisine as well as any cuisine. I like to look at menus and recreate what
        I ordered at home. My music taste is a HUGE range and I listen to music every chance I can get as well as
        go to concerts, both locally and around the country. I currently have over 200 video games and growing, although
        my time doesn't seem to be growing with the collection size.</p>
