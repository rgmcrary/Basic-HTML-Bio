            <p>I've always been too analytic for my own good, so naturally, coding seemed to be a great fit. I enjoy creating and disassembling things to see how
            they "work" and I think this is a perfect avenue to explore and take advantage of this natural tendency.</p>         
            <p>My hobbies include cooking, music (both recorded and live), video games and traveling. I have studied the Korean
            language and enjoy cooking Korean cuisine as well as any cuisine. I like to look at menus and recreate what
            I ordered at home. </p>
